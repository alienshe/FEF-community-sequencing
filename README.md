# FEF-community-sequencing

This repository contains details and code used for data analysis of sequencing data obtained from the sequencing of fungal ITS amplicons from _Melaleuca quinquenervia_ trees as part of an honours project: Investigating diversity of foliar endophytic fungi in _Meleleuca quinquenervia_ trees in response to the pathogen _Austropuccinia psidii_ by Sylvie Nolf.

After sequencing, reads were processed and analysed according to the methods outlined in the Read filtering, clustering, and BLAST search markdown file. Analysis in R then continued as shown in the sequence_analysis.Rmd file. To see the formatting and outputs of the R code, please download the corresponding html file and view it in your browser. Alternatively, you can easily view the html file using this link: http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/alienshe/FEF-community-sequencing-repo/blob/main/sequencing_analysis.html.
