# FEF-community-sequencing

This repository contains details and code used for data analysis of sequencing data obtained from the sequencing of fungal ITS amplicons from _Melaleuca quinquenervia_ trees as part of an honours project.

After sequencing, reads were processed and analysed according to the methods outlined in the Read filtering, clustering, and BLAST search markdown file. Analysis in R then continued as shown in the R_anlysis markdown file.
